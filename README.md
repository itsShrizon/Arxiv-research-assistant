See `arxiv-mcp-server` in action! This short video provides a walkthrough of the main features and functionalities.

### **Important Note on Video Display in READMEs:**

GitHub Markdown (and most standard Markdown renderers) **does not natively support embedding video players or displaying video *previews* directly from Google Drive links.** This is why you haven't seen a proper video thumbnail.

For the best visual experience (a clickable image that previews the video), the recommended approach is to upload your demo to **YouTube**.

### **Option 1: (Highly Recommended) If you upload your demo to YouTube**

This method provides a proper thumbnail and a smooth viewing experience directly within GitHub.

1.  Upload your video to YouTube.
2.  Get the video ID from its URL (e.g., for `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`, the ID is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`).
3.  Use the following Markdown, replacing `YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` with your actual video ID:

    ```markdown
    [![Watch the Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID)
    ```
    (Example with a placeholder YouTube ID for demonstration):
    [![Watch the Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### **Option 2: (Current) Using your Google Drive link**

Since a direct visual preview isn't possible, we'll use a clear, clickable **badge** that directs users to your Google Drive video. This is the most effective way to present a Google Drive video link in a visually appealing and unambiguous manner in a README.
